        <p>
            This plugin adds tools for working with firmware images such as a filesystem
            abstraction built upon <a href="https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk">binwalk</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch">sasquatch</a> which must both
            be installed on your system.
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
        <p>
            After having installed this plugin you should configure it which is done through
            <tt>Edit-&gt;Tool Options-&gt;Firmware Plugin</tt>.

            <a href="https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk">Binwalk</a>
            is a tool for carving out offsets of "interesing" chunks in a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            This plugin uses binwalk as a sort of filesystem where each
            chunk is a separate file. One file type inside a firmware
            image could be a root filesystem which can then be opened
            and inspected.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch">Sasquatch</a>
            is a patch for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/">SquashFS tools</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
            SquashFS is one of the most common root filesystem types for embedded Linux systems.
            It is well defined but many vendors have implemented their own modifications to it
            meaning that the original tools cannot work with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sasquatch seeks to fix this by adding many of these modifications.
        </p>

        <p>
            Often times when having analyzed one firmware from a vendor
            you would like to look at other versions of the same firmware
            or firmware for similar devices. Often these can be downloaded
            from the vendors website but this takes time. I have scraped
            many vendors website for firmware and put them on a web server
            for this plugin to index. This option should point to this
            web server.
